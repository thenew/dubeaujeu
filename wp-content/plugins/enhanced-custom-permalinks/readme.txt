Requires at least: 3.0
Tested up to: 4.0.1
Stable tag: 0.0.1

Set custom permalinks on a per-post, per-tag or per-category basis.

== Description ==

This plugin is a fork of the Custom-Permalinks plugin.  It has some expanded bug patches AND is able to interoperate with the WP-no-category-base plugin.

This plugin will allow you to set permalinks in a more precise way - in short you can include sub-folders.  A page could have the permalink http://www.example.com/aFolder/anotherFolder/page.html without having to create the intermediate pages or categories aFolder/anotherFolder/.

Be warned: *This plugin is not a replacement for WordPress's built-in permalink system*. Check your WordPress
administration's "Permalinks" settings page first, to make sure that this doesn't already meet your needs.

This plugin is only useful for assigning custom permalinks for *individual* posts, pages, tags or categories. 
It will not apply whole permalink structures, or automatically apply a category's custom permalink to the posts 
within that category.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the package, and upload `enhanced-custom-permalinks` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Edit any post, page, tag or category to set a custom permalink.

== Changelog ==
